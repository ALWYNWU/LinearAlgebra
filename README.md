## A simple linear algebra learning process using Python

This is a projec to recording my relearning process of linear algebra, it will include some basic knowledges about vector, matrix and numpy,
the implementation part will use python language. 

[Vectors]()  
[Matrix]()  
[Linear System]()  
[Invertibility of a matrix]()  
[Linearly dependent, linearly independent, Generate space]()  
[Vector space, dimensions]()  
[Orthogonality]()
[Coordinate transformation and linear transformation]()  
[Determinant]()  
[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors]()  
[Symmetric matrix and SVD decomposition]()
